1. Create dedicated tabs for calibration and or taring for main sensors only Gyroscope Magnetometer and Accelerometer 
2. To demonstate linear accelration and or the magnetometer values, using a ball or cube made up of large voxels which would 
increase thier spacing next to each other based on the vector values. 
3. To demonstate the gravity sensor a plane could a be a translucent red when not level and translucent green to indicate it is.
